# Data processing for SO289 cruise

The SO289 research cruise on FS Sonne occurred during the 2022 austral autumn, traveling from Valparaiso to Noumea in the South Pacific Ocean. The primary focus was on trace element biogeochemistry and chemical oceanography, also incorporating physical and biological aspects. The mission aimed to extensively analyze the distribution, origins, and depletions of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs) in a lesser-explored ocean region. This study sought to understand TEI biogeochemical cycles, their link to surface ocean productivity, and their role in carbon and nitrogen cycles, especially considering some TEIs serve as micronutrients. These insights are crucial for grasping the chemical foundation of marine ecosystems.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Describe steps or methods used to clean the data, such as handling missing values.
2. **Normalization/Standardization**: If applicable, detail the process.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Discuss any new features or metrics derived from the raw data.
... (and so on for other processing steps)
